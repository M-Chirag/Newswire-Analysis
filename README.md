Analyzing and Classifying Newswires to tackle misinformation and fake news

The objective of my project is to develop and use algorithms that can automatically group together news articles that have a similar meaning after being educated on collections of texts from newswires in a dataset.
I intend to use the concepts we learnt in class (INFO202) to build topic clusters and analyze the sentiments based on the word embeddings in the newswires. The concepts used here are categorization, tokenization, forming hierarchical structures, and semantic similarities with word embeddings. This can assist in directing us to develop a tidy and disciplined organization system for gathering and arranging massive amounts of text information. These word level embeddings, in my opinion, may be used to organize the topics in news articles to tackle the spread of misinformation. Additionally, I have applied the concept of grounded coding to assign codes to the top 10 topics from the dataset and compare them to the one generated by the LDA model using the Inter-Annotator Agreement.
